<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">Education is the transmission of knowledge, skills, and character traits. 
    There are many debates about its precise definition, for example, about which aims it tries to achieve.
     A further issue is whether part of the meaning of education is that the change in the student is an improvement.
      Some researchers stress the role of critical thinking to distinguish education from indoctrination.
       These disagreements affect how to identify, measure, and improve forms of education. 
       The term can also refer to the mental states and qualities of educated people. Additionally, 
       it can mean the academic field studying education </p>

<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">There are many types of education. Formal education happens in a complex 
    institutional framework, like public schools. Non-formal education is also structured but happens outside
     the formal schooling system. Informal education is unstructured learning through daily experiences.
      Formal and non-formal education are divided into levels. They include early childhood education,
       primary education, secondary education, and tertiary education. Other classifications focus on
        the teaching method, like teacher-centered and student-centered education. Forms of education 
        can also be distinguished by subject, like science education, language education, and physical education. </p>

<p class="sectionSubTag text-small">The main field investigating education is called education studies.
     It examines what education is and what aims it has. It also studies how it happens, what effects 
     it has, and how to improve it. It has many subfields, like philosophy of education, psychology of 
     education, sociology of education, economics of education, and comparative education. It also discusses
      the history of education. In prehistory, education happened informally through oral communication and
       imitation. With the rise of ancient civilizations, writing was invented, and the amount of knowledge grew.
        This caused a shift from informal to formal education. Initially, formal education was mainly available to
         elites and religious groups. The invention of the printing press in the 15th century made books more widely
          available. This increased general literacy. Beginning in the 18th and 19th centuries, public education became
           more important. It led to the worldwide process of making primary education available to all, free of charge,
            and compulsory up to a certain age.. </p>
